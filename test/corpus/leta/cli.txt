Usage: leta [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

  Leta (LSP Enabled Tools for Agents) is a command line LSP client. It can
  quickly search for symbols across large code bases with regular expressions,
  print full function and method bodies, find references, implementations,
  subtypes, etc. It also has refactoring tools, like renaming symbols across
  the entire code base.

  `leta grep` can be much better than naive text search tools when you want to
  understand a code base. Note that `leta grep` only exposes symbols that are
  declared in its workspace, so use (rip)grep or other search tools when
  you're looking for specific multi-symbol strings, puncuation, or library
  functions. `leta grep PATTERN [PATH] --docs` prints function and method
  documentation for all matching symbols.

  `leta files` is a good starting point when starting work on a project.

  Use `leta show SYMBOL` to print the full body of a symbol. Use `leta refs
  SYMBOL` to find all uses of a symbol. These two (and other) commands accept
  `--context N` for surrounding lines.

  See `leta COMMAND --help` for more documentation and command-specific
  options.

Options:
  --json      Output as JSON
  -h, --help  Show this message and exit.
