leta --help
---
Leta (LSP Enabled Tools for Agents) is a command line LSP client. It can
quickly search for symbols across large code bases with regular expressions,
print full function and method bodies, find references, implementations,
subtypes, etc. It also has refactoring tools, like renaming symbols across the
entire code base.

`leta grep` can be much better than naive text search tools when you want to
understand a code base. Note that `leta grep` only exposes symbols that are
declared in its workspace, so use (rip)grep or other search tools when you're
looking for specific multi-symbol strings, puncuation, or library functions.
`leta grep PATTERN [PATH] --docs` prints function and method documentation for
all matching symbols.

`leta files` is a good starting point when starting work on a project.

Use `leta show SYMBOL` to print the full body of a symbol. Use `leta refs
SYMBOL` to find all uses of a symbol. These two (and other) commands accept
`--context N` for surrounding lines.

See `leta COMMAND --help` for more documentation and command-specific options.
